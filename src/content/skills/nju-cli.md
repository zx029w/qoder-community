## Notes

- The install command shallow-clones the Codex marketplace repository, then copies the `nju-cli` skill, scripts, and all bundled binaries into `~/.qoder/skills/nju-cli`.
- Bundled binaries are copied for macOS Apple Silicon, Linux x86_64, and Windows x86_64.
- Some eHall workflows may require valid Nanjing University credentials and network access to campus services.
